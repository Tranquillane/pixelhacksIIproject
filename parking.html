		<p>You've disembarked from your car. A sign reading "Pixelhacks II" points towards the elevator.</p>
		<p>You enter the elevator and press the "1" button. A short flight later, the doors open. Many other people await you.</p>
		<p>You sign in at the table.</p>
		<p>You are escorted through to another elevator with a group of nine others. You ascend and exit the elevator, walking to another building where others are sitting on tables, walking around, chatting, grabbing free swag, etc.</p>
